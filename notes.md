- don't sort within for loop -- sort after
- `int[]` faster than `ArrayList<Integer>`
- when reading strings use `fin.next()` over `fin.nextLine()` -- less prone to errors
- remove/comment `sout` before submission
- use `int` when var < 2^31 or 2,147,483,648
- time complexity should be under 10^8/second
